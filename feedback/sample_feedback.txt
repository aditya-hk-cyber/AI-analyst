# Feedback Report - Sample

## Question/Task Completed
Analyzed user engagement metrics for the past week.

## Knowledge Availability Assessment
- The metrics.txt file had good coverage of basic metrics like DAU and watch time
- However, the "user engagement" metric definition was unclear
- Missing information about how engaged_users differs from paid_users

## Knowledge Quality Assessment
- Found inconsistency: metrics.txt mentions "engaged_users" but doesn't clearly explain the calculation
- The examples in examples.txt are helpful but lack diversity - need more complex query patterns

## Gaps and Missing Information

### Catalog gaps
- The catalog.txt doesn't clearly explain relationships between daylevel_metric and daylevel_engagedpaid tables
- Missing documentation on timezone handling for different tables

### Metrics gaps
- Need clearer definition of "engaged_users" vs "paid_users"
- Missing formula for calculating engagement rate

### Examples gaps
- Need more examples showing how to join multiple tables
- Missing examples for time-series analysis queries

## Suggestions for Knowledge Base Enhancement
- Add a section in metrics.txt explaining the difference between engaged_users and paid_users
- Add more complex query examples showing multi-table joins
- Update catalog.txt with clearer table relationship documentation
